Toronto’s commute has often been considered one of the worst in the world. The city’s public transport system faces various criticisms as it has a much smaller subway network system compared to cities with similar size. Most of people in Toronto commute using cars as a result leading to frequent traffics and potential accidents. Toronto Police compiled data from 2006-2019 on Killed or Seriously Injured accidents in the city of Toronto over this time period. This project aims to identify the potential variables leading to a serious/fatal accident in Toronto.
